  * Properly report 'no variant' errors for multis from roles. Reported by
    osfameron.

0.09  Thu, 15 Oct 2009 23:47:36 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::Method::Signatures 0.29 because 0.28 slightly broken in a
    way that caused utter fail with multi methods. Reported by Justin Hunter.

0.08  Mon, 28 Sep 2009 18:03:14 +0200
  * Implement better error reporting on ambiguous matches.

0.07  Mon, 31 Aug 2009 19:51:44 +0200
  * Fix failure in t/mxd.t if MooseX::Declare isn't available.

0.06  Mon, 31 Aug 2009 19:18:03 +0200
  * Adapt to yet another change in MooseX::Method::Signatures 0.24.

0.05  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 15:39:40 +0200
  * Adapt to MooseX::Method::Signatures 0.22.

0.04  Sun, 16 Aug 2009 12:00:01 +0200
  * Only set up MXMS for the caller if it doesn't already have a method keyword
    installed (Closes RT#46705).

0.03  Fri, 08 May 2009 00:33:59 +0200
  * Redispatch upwards if possible, instead of quickly resigning to an error
    when no variant was found in a class (Sartak).

0.02  Wed, 22 Apr 2009 01:56:49 +0200
  * Depend on MooseX::Types::VariantTable 0.02.
    It sorts Types topologically now. All variants in a single
    slot are tried for a match, and if the result is ambiguous
    an error is thrown. This matches Perl 6's behavior for multi
    method dispatch.

0.01  Mon, 13 Apr 2009 06:12:44 +0200
  * Initial release.
